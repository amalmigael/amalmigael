<h3>Connection</h3>


What is it that makes us "humane"?



Its that connection between us.



what is a connection?

It's a powerful bond, not visible through a naked eye, still, far greater than every other bond we've ever made artificially.

Its the interlink between every human being that ever was,ever is & ever will be in this beautiful ball of life we call "earth".

Its the ability to understand, to comprehend, to transpire an idea, a thought, a feeling

from one single human being to his/her fellow human being.



How are we able to connect?



A linguist might suggest its made possible by "communication" by the means of languages.



Is it mere languages?

we sit at home saying we're a group of people united by thier own languages with respect to their geographical area.

Are we?

are we that small group or are we much more than that?



Think of our primates

they didn't have a well-defined means of communication

the concept of a language didn't even exist back then.



still, they were able to not just "thrive" but to "live"

to connect, to know every bit of happiness, sadness, pain & pleasure

just like each of us today

they made their life wondrous in their own way



was it because of language?

No, Its always possible because we have something inside of us.

the connection to visualize the unseen that is unexpressed yet felt

to hear the unspoken yet not spoken about.



Its the most magnificent ability of human beings to understand, to ideate, to integrate

with our loved ones, from the ones that we've already met to the one's that are yet to be met.



what makes this possible?

because we're all united in the making.

because we're all made out of the same stuff

as Carl sagan once called it STAR STUFF



so, hold on to your connections,

nurture it, expand it

so that one day we may bridge the gaps that are only physically there,

so that we may consider the planet and its beings as one rather than with man-made boundaries,

so that we may one day unite in the name of Earth.

because that is what it means to be truly "humane".
